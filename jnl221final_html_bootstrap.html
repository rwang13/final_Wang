						<h5><strong>What is the Child Soldiers Prevention Act (CSPA)?</strong></h5>
					</div>
						<p>In armed conflicts worldwide, children are among the most vulnerable populations. Too often, children bear the brunt of violence and are exploited by armed organizations to serve on the frontlines and as child soldiers in military operations.</p>
						<p>Regarding how Congress defines child soldier abuse, the United States is a party to the <a href="https://childrenandarmedconflict.un.org/tools-for-action/opac/" target="_blank">Optional Protocol of the Rights of the Child</a>, stating that it is illegal to recruit persons below age 18. This prevention is referred to as the “Zero Under 18” campaign.</p>
						<p>The United States is also one of the few countries in the world that emphasizes the link between “arms sales and military assistance” and “child soldier recruitment” and utilizes national legislation to leverage such support to halt the use of child soldiers.</p>
						<p>In 2008, Congress established a law explicitly to target and prevent the exploitation of children in armed conflict, known as the <a href="https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/135981.pdf" target="_blank">Child Soldiers Prevention Act (CSPA)</a>. In 2009, the CSPA officially took effect to protect the rights of minors. Annually, the CSPA Implementation Tracker, published in the U.S. Department of State’s annual Trafficking in Persons Report, would request a list from the U.S. Secretary of State for countries that recruited child soldiers. Once identified, these countries are prohibited from receiving certain types of U.S. military assistance, training, and defense equipment in the following fiscal year.</p>

						<h5><strong>A Major Limitation of the CSPA</strong></h5>
					</div>
						<p>However, there is one limitation with the CSPA. The President has complete control under the CSPA to decide to waive or not waive a country’s request due to the “national interest of the United States.”</p>
						<p>When asked for its legitimacy, some political pundits believe that the presidential waiver should be encouraged since it certifies to Congress that the government is taking adequate steps to address child soldier abuse.</p>
						<p>In stark contrast, others argue that the President office’s bias can be controversial and may play a significant part in the equation of wrongfully discriminating against certain countries and subsequently losing the financial balance. For instance, Pakistan was added to the 2021 CSPA list by President Biden's command. However, the spokesman for Pakistan Foreign Office asserted that the CSPA list depicts a factual error and lacks understanding, as the Pakistan military does not support any non-state armed groups nor child soldier recruitment.</p>
						<p>In other words, CSPA-listed countries are divided into two main types: (1) the ones that claim that they are innocent and do not want financial support from the U.S. and (2) the ones that admit they have been practicing child soldier recruitment and would like to request money to combat the status quo.
						<p>To further clarify, the following Stimson Center data set used and findings generated can be somewhat subjective due to the bias in CSPA-listed countries. Yet, the numerical values are important for journalistic analysis because they showcase what the United States has done to prevent child soldier abuse.</p>

						<h5><strong>The Stimson Center: Child Soldiers Project and Data Analytics</strong></h5>
					</div>
					<p>In 2021, there are a total 15 CSPA-listed countries identified: Pakistan, Turkey, Afghanistan, Myanmar, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen.</p>
					<p>Compared to 2011, a decade ago, there were only 6 countries, which is 2.5 times greater. This increasing trend suggests that the U.S. starts to treat global child abuse more seriously and becomes harsher in implementing the CSPA.</p>
                	<p>Regarding the correlation between national interest waivers and the growing size of the CSPA list, <a href="https://www.stimson.org/ppl/shannon-dick/" target="_blank"> Shannon Dick</a>, the Chief Research Analyst of the Child Soldiers Data Analytics Project at the Stimson Center, provides insight:</p>
					<p class="pull-quote">"More often than not over the law’s history, the U.S. president has elected to use national interest waivers – either in part or in full – to allow the majority of CSPA-listed governments to receive otherwise-prohibited U.S. arms sales and military assistance."</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<iframe title="Total dollars waived, sorted by CSPA categories, 2011-2021" aria-label="Grouped Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-AA63M" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AA63M/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="214"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<p>For CSPA-listed countries that do request financial aid from the U.S. to help reduce child soldier abuse, the waiver types mostly fall into "arms sales" and "military assistance."</p>
					<p>From the total amount waived to salvage the situation of child soldier abuse, the U.S. has given out 4.5 billion dollars for arms sales and nearly 3.3 billion dollars for military assistance.</p>
					<p>It is axiomatic that the U.S. is in favor of waiving arms sales due to the approximate 1.2 billion dollars of a difference. This phenomenon occurs because the U.S. holds the lion's share of international arms sales at <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2021/03/15/report-the-us-accounts-for-37-of-global-arms-exports-infographic/?sh=230c7a58f193" target="_blank">37%</a>, whereas the U.S. military assistance programs disappoint because large-scale interventions are costly and unpopular.</p>
					<p>According to Dick's research, she illustrates the waiving progress of the CSPA:</p>
					<p class="pull-quote">"97% of the CSPA's prohibitions on arms sales and military assistance to these countries has been waived."</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<iframe title="Total dollars waived by the U.S. government to support the CSPA, 2011-2021" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-H3Dnu" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/H3Dnu/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<p>Furthermore, the CSPA list produces some other noticeable statistics and interesting information.</p>
					<p>Before 2017, the total amount waived was slowly increasing. During former U.S. President Donald Trump's first year of reign, he sought to increase military spending, directly resulting in the peak of the CSPA waived amount with shockingly more than 4 billion dollars worth of investment.</p>
					<p>During Trump's second year of reign, it was expected that the waived amount dropped because he was changing some of his military plans. Nonetheless, 2019 was when the waived amount started to increase again. Once Covid-19 hit the globe, from 2019 to 2021, the CSPA waived amount began to decline drastically since the national needs were lopsided toward supporting the medical field (e.g., providing masks and expanding living capacity in hospitals).</p>
					<p>As a result, if the waived amount in 2022 decreases even more, it is safe to assume that the U.S. is indirectly adding more burden on the issue of child soldier abuse. That is to say, the U.S. has no choice but to invest more money in the CSPA to raise awareness like it used to.</p>

						<h5><strong>How can global citizens raise awareness on child soldier abuse?</strong></h5>
					</div>
					<p>As ordinary citizens, we do not have the authoritative power to influence the CSPA. But, we do have the power to spread awareness on social media. For instance, as suggested by Human Rights Watch, we can participate in the Red Hand Day on every year's February 12th:
					<p class="pull-quote">"Use red paint to make a handprint on a sheet of paper, and add a personal message about your desire to end the use of child soldiers. Share your activities! Upload photos or videos of your event to http://www.redhandday.org/ and send an email to redhandday@hrw.org."</p>
					<p>Another way to acknowledge such abuse is through listening to the stories of child soldiers themselves. Emmanuel Jal, the author of "War Child," detailed his hardship as a former child soldier and recalled his lowest point in life where starvation almost turned him into a cannibal.</p>
					<p>At the end of the day, no matter which way you decide to choose, raising awareness of child soldier recruitment is essential because children deserve to grow up in safe environments and be given a bright future away from physical pain and traumatic experiences.</p>
